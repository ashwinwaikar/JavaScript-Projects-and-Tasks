            My name is Ashwin Waikar.I am the youngest child in my family. I have two elder sisters.
            My mum is a full time housewife and my dad is a Businessman.

            It is a common knowledge that I am a good student and I love to study a lot.
            My favorite programming languages are Java,JavaScript and C++.
            I’m what a lot of people call a geek.
            I have every intention of applying to a reputable company and obtaining a well position in these fields.
            I am responsible and hardworking, so I study hard to obtain good grades.
        </p>

            I have always been treated like a baby, by my parents, siblings, teachers and basically everyone who is not
            in my age group. Sometimes even my friends talk to me like I am a child, which is why I basically love
            school and reading books. Books don’t talk back at you and they make me feel important in this gigantic
            universe.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not to say that I don’t love all the care and attention.
            I do, it’s just that sometimes it can get stifling. However, I am quite content with my life.
